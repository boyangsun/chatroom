how to use:
1. pick a nickname then click on the check button to see whether the name is taken or not.
2. by default, everyone are in the lobby after picking their name. click on "lobby" in the availiable room list, it should load all of the users in lobby right now.
3. create normal room or private room by using the input boxes and buttons at the bottom of the page.
(put the room name and password in the boxes then hit create)
4. new users can join the rooms by clicking on the rooms in the availiable room list.
5. normal message: write in the text area then hit send message.
6. private message: write in the text area, put the name of the receiver in the input box then hit send private message.
7. creator can kick or ban people by clicking on the kick and ban button.

creative portion:
1. There is a sending time in front of every message, including normal message and private message.
2. I made a label at the top of the each user's page, indicating which room he or she is in.
